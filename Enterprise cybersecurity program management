Enterprise cybersecurity program management ties together risk management, control management, deficiency tracking, process improvement, and measurement processes into a single overarching programmatic cycle. 
￼

The enterprise cybersecurity program management process consists of the following major steps: 

Assess assets, threats, and risks:
	⁃	This step involves considering the missions of potential attackers
	⁃	Well-defined cybersecurity scopes simplify the defensive process by ensuring that defensive measures focus on the needs of the security scope, rather than trying to protect everything from every possible threat simultaneously. 
	⁃	This step’s output is an understanding of the enterprise assets to be protected and the threats against those assets. 
	⁃	ensure that the defensive measures applied to each scope are appropriate and the most economical way to achieve the desired protection. 
	
	
Identify security scopes 
	⁃	group the previously identified enterprise assets and the threats and risks against them into security scopes for protection
	⁃	Enterprise cybersecurity capabilities should be tied to security scopes, and while many scopes may use the same security capabilities.
	⁃	scope boundaries are important for ensuring the right levels of capabilities are employed in the right places. 
	⁃	It is also important to maintain the right balance between restrictive security and permissive operations so the enterprise can operate efficiently and effectively. 
	⁃	Additionally, security scopes are useful in identifying regulated data and systems, and ensuring regulations are adhered to in a practical and economical fashion. By establishing well-bounded security scopes, the enterprise can dramatically simplify the cybersecurity effort by only applying controls and mitigations where they are most needed and where the operational trade-offs of those controls are acceptable. 
	⁃	2 challenges when using scope boundaries to compartmentalize security. 
	⁃	The first challenge: the enterprise must keep track of which policies, rules, and controls apply to which scope, potentially increasing complexity. The enterprise can counter this challenge by having only a limited number of scopes, clearly aligned with the business’s regulatory obligations and cybersecurity architecture. For example, systems handling regulated data such as financials regulated by Sarbanes-Oxley, payment card information regulated by PCI-DSS, or medical information regulated by HIPAA might be placed into separate scopes to ensure their protection.
	⁃	The second challenge: systems that cross scope boundaries, such as data interconnects and systems administration consoles. In these cases, compensating controls may be necessary to ensure the interconnections do not become security vulnerabilities. A common example of this situation involves systems administration workstations, which typically are nothing more than regular personal computers that are used with very powerful systems administration credentials. Allowing these systems to receive e-mail, surf the web, and run office productivity applications may open them up to targeted attacks that would give the attackers significant administrative permissions. 

Assess risk mitigations, capabilities by functional area, and security operations 
	⁃	assess the security of the scope. 
	⁃	This assessment can be performed using risk mitigations, the 11 functional areas of cybersecurity capabilities, and security operations. Using this book’s methodology, assessment results include Object Measurement scores for the cybersecurity functional areas and can also include an aggregate score for the complete enterprise cybersecurity posture. 
	⁃	Looking at risk mitigations, the enterprise uses the attack sequence to evaluate its ability to disrupt, detect, delay, and defeat attacks against its assets. This evaluation considers each potential attack scenario and then aggregates the results together. Looking at security capabilities, the enterprise examines the 11 functional areas and calculates scores for each of the functional areas. One area of focus involves looking out for functional areas that are deficient when compared to the other functional areas. Finally, looking at security operations, the enterprise examines the 17 security operational processes. The enterprise assesses its ability to perform these processes to operate its cybersecurity systems. 
	⁃	Once the enterprise has scores for these areas, the scores can be aggregated and compared for evaluation and further analysis. The overall enterprise cybersecurity program assessment score can be tracked over time to show quantitatively how the cybersecurity posture evolves as improvements are implemented. The overall score can be evaluated within the security scope to determine if the scope is adequately or inadequately protected. If the security scope is inadequately protected, then specific activities can be implemented to reach a stated improvement goal or target assessment score. 

Identify target security levels 
	⁃	use risk assessment methodology to identify the target security levels and understand if the scope’s current security is adequate, inadequate, or even excessive. 
	⁃	Generally, it is not cost-effective or practical to deliver “perfect” security to every part of the enterprise. Various parts of the business require different security postures to satisfy business needs while giving employees the freedoms they may desire. Various parts of the business require different preventive, detective, forensic, and audit controls. 
	⁃	Security scopes accommodate these realities by limiting the number of systems and people who are subject to the most stringent security protection. Security scopes help prioritize limited cybersecurity resources toward the areas where they will deliver the greatest enterprise benefits. Security scopes also simplify the cybersecurity process by reducing the attack surface of vulnerable systems and increasing cybersecurity’s ability to succeed through that simplicity. 
	⁃	For each security scope and associated assets, this step involves identifying threats, risks, and a target security level. 
	⁃	The identified security level represents the business tolerance for potential compromise within the scope. 
	⁃	Furthermore, the security level is used to balance the severity of the threats with the business desire for flexibility and unobtrusive security that does not impede business agility. Different parts of the enterprise require different levels of protection, but the security infrastructure requires the greatest level of protection so that it can successfully protect the rest of the enterprise. 
	•	Identify deficient areas 
	⁃	Once the enterprise has identified its security scopes, actual security within the scopes, and established target security levels, the next step is to identify which areas are deficient and require improvement when compared to the targets. 
	⁃	Identifying deficient areas produces results to include the following: 
	⁃	First, the target security level for the security scope might be too high or too low. In this situation, when the enterprise considers what additional security capabilities might be necessary, the associated costs, and potential operational trade-offs, the business may determine that a different security posture is more appropriate. When a different security posture is required, the target security level can be adjusted either up or down, and the evaluation can be reconsidered. 
	⁃	Second, during the assessment, some functional areas are likely to stand out as being considerably weaker than other areas. These weaker areas should be prioritized for improvements first. Shoring up the weaker functional areas with improvements addresses the cybersecurity gaps that are the most likely to be exploited by potential attackers. 
	⁃	Third, after the most deficient functional areas are addressed, the next improvement phase involves bringing all areas up to the target level of security. This phase often involves a comprehensive effort to improve risk mitigations, security capabilities, and security operations. 

Prioritize remediation and improvements 
	⁃	Once the enterprise understands its “as-is” cybersecurity posture, as well as its security needs for each scope, the next step is to prioritize remediation and improvement efforts. 
	⁃	This prioritization is influenced by the following factors: 
	⁃	Bringing deficient functional areas up to target levels of security 
	⁃	Improvements that rely on other improvements as prerequisites 
	⁃	Availability and skill levels of available staff and contractors 
	⁃	Costs of improvements 
	⁃	The goal is to address deficient enterprise cybersecurity functional areas first, then work on bringing all functional areas up to the target cybersecurity level in a balanced manner. 
	⁃	As improvements are prioritized and sequenced, they can be logically grouped into four different categories. This categorization is based on practical assessments of what should be done in what order and when different efforts can realistically be resourced. These categories can be maintained across all security scopes provided the scopes of improvements are clearly identified within each project. Improvements should be grouped into the following categories: 
	⁃	Immediate: improvements that can be done starting immediately using readily available staff and budget 
	⁃	This Year: improvements that can be done within the current year using resources that are obtainable in the year or after minor prerequisites or other dependencies have been addressed 
	⁃	Next Year improvements that should be done next year, after completing the immediate and this year projects, and obtaining budgets, approvals, or satisfying other prerequisites 
	⁃	Future: improvements that are lower priority or will require obtaining budget, hiring staff, completing prerequisites or satisfying other non-trivial requirements before they can begin  
	⁃	Within each of these categories, improvements can be further prioritized and sub-grouped, but at the highest level this grouping is helpful to start aligning cybersecurity priorities with business financial cycles so that work can be resourced and executed. Obviously, projects and tasks will move around on these priority lists and get moved forward or back in the sequencing as priorities change and time passes. Having a “big picture” story to tell leadership about where the enterprise is, where it is going, and how it is going to get there is important. Business leadership wants to understand that such prioritized improvements are not just spending money or buying new cybertoys. Maintaining the cybersecurity strategy grouped into these four categories simply makes it easier for security to manage and explain its priorities and plans to enterprise leadership. 

Resource and execute improvements 
	⁃	Once improvements are prioritized, the enterprise can begin resourcing and executing them. This resourcing process generally involves the following tasks that are conducted in parallel against each category grouping of improvements: 
	⁃	For Immediate improvements, cybersecurity leadership directs the work and supervises its progress. 
	⁃	For This Year improvements, cybersecurity leadership works on lining up resources, shuffling priorities, or completing prerequisites so the actual improvement can start work within the current year. 
	⁃	For Next and Future improvements, cybersecurity leadership starts framing project plans and resource requirements so they can be considered and budgeted in future fiscal years. Many times, improvements are pushed back because they are too big or expensive to execute in a foreseeable time frame. In such cases, it is helpful to consider creative ways to break these projects up into smaller pieces that are more manageable and potentially fundable. Alternatively, it may help to link their benefits to other business needs so they have business support from multiple departments. 


Collect operational metrics 
	⁃	As the enterprise executes its improvements and operates its security program, the next step in the programmatic sequence is to collect metrics from cybersecurity operations. These metrics should span all functional areas, with particular emphasis paid to metrics that measure signs of security incidents and near-incidents, or indicators of attacker activities indicating the presence of anticipated threats. 
	⁃	These metrics give enterprise leadership visibility into what the threats are, where they are coming from, and what can result if the threats are not stopped before they can succeed. 
	⁃	Even relatively crude metrics, like “The enterprise was scanned a million times last month,” can be useful if metrics are tracked and trended over time. For example, tracking and trending threats could show that the million scans are an increase from only ten thousand from the previous month. Security takes on a whole new urgency if enterprise leadership has a mental picture of attackers who are just waiting to pounce at the slightest mistake or vulnerability. 


Return to Step 1 
	•	After collecting metrics, the cybersecurity program management process returns to the assessment phase and the cycle repeats. This assess ➤ prioritize ➤ execute ➤ operate cycle should go through a complete iteration multiple times each year. During each cycle, the enterprise updates its threat assessment, takes stock of completed security improvements, identifies new security improvements to implement, and lines up future security improvements for execution when resources become available. 
	•	As this cycle iterates, security projects move through the various priority categories until they are executed. A project might start out on the Future category, then get moved to the Next Year category, then to the This Year category, and finally to the Immediate category for execution. In addition to this natural flow, projects get inserted into the categories due to incidents, new threats, or IT projects requiring additional protections. This insertion provides the enterprise a flexible framework for managing its overall cybersecurity program. The framework also provides the ability to report on both immediate activities and the big picture strategy at any time. Moreover, this overall strategy helps to balance effectively cybersecurity with business needs in a cost-effective manner.
